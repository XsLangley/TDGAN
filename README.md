> Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a challenging task in computer vision as features extracted from expressional images are usually entangled with other facial attributes, e.g., poses or appearance variations, which are adverse to FER. To achieve a better FER performance, we propose a model named Two-branch Disentangled Generative Adversarial Network (TDGAN) for discriminative expression representation learning. Different from previous methods, TDGAN learns to disentangle expressional information from other unrelated facial attributes. To this end, we build the framework with two independent branches, which are specific for facial and expressional information processing respectively. Correspondingly, two discriminators are introduced to conduct identity and expression classification. By adversarial learning, TDGAN is able to transfer an expression to a given face. It simultaneously learns a discriminative representation that is disentangled from other facial attributes for each expression image, which is more effective for FER task. In addition, a self-supervised mechanism is proposed to improve representation learning, which enhances the power of disentangling. Quantitative and qualitative results in both in-the-lab and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that TDGAN is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods.

## Quick Start: one evaluation step with a pretrained model
1. Download the model file from:
    - Google Drive: click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10zYyQWO1hp9q1MhAmt4ioD42g-88QtBv/view?usp=sharing)
    - BaiduYun: click [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Rt-KQEGWMqjb2CcCVtpjug), (auth code: uyii).
2. Extract the pretrained model and place it under the directory: `./Dataset/examples`
3. Go for a quick demo through command: ``python main.py``. This command will perform an evaluation step and generate an image under directory `./Dataset/examples`, with a file name of `generated_example.png`.

## Requirements

- Pytorch > 1.3
- Pillow

## Model Description

The framework of the model:
<p align="left"><img width="100%" src="assets/framework.jpg" /></p>

TDGAN learns image representations through expression transferring.
The inputs are two images: one facial image with identity label and one expressional image with expression label.
The goal of the generator is to transfer the expression from the expressional image to the face image.
Therefore, TDGAN includes two separate branch for extracting corresponding image representations and then using a deconv-based decoder to generate the image.
To make sure that the generated image fulfills our expectation, there are two discriminators for TDGAN to evaluate the generated image.
One is a face discriminator, which conducts identity classification (so that TDGAN can know whether the face appearance in the generated image is the same as that of the input facial image).
The other is an expression discriminator, which conducts expression classification (so that TDGAN can know whether the expression in the generated image is the same as that of the input expressional image).
Note that the expected identity information can only be extracted from the input facial image, while the expected expression information can only be extracted from the input expressional image.
Therefore, by adversarial training, the face branch will tend to extract only identity (facial appearance) related features while the expression branch will tend to extract only expression related features.
In other word, the expression branch is induced to disentangle expressional features from other features.
We can therefore take such expression-specific features for expression classification task.
