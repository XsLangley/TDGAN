This is the code repository of model TDGAN.
The paper is available at [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9197663/).


## Quick Start

### Pretrained Model Preparation

1. Download model parameters from:
    - Google Drive: click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10zYyQWO1hp9q1MhAmt4ioD42g-88QtBv/view?usp=sharing)
    - BaiduYun: click [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Rt-KQEGWMqjb2CcCVtpjug), (auth code: uyii).
2. Extract the pretrained model and place it under the directory: `Dataset/examples`
3. Go for a quick demo through command: ``python main.py``. This command will perform an evaluation step and generate an image under directory `Dataset/examples`, with a file name of `generated_example.png`.

## More Details

Detailed descriptions will be added soon.
